What do I do about my dad‚Äôs political opinions?,"So first off, I greatly love my dad very much. I would say he is a good father to me and my sister. He paid for my college schooling (I only did community college, have no interest in getting anything further, and I would have to go into debt as he couldn‚Äôt afford it). I am and will forever be grateful for him in my life.
 
 However.
 
 Him and I greatly disagree on many things politically. This might not sound like a big deal, but it does kind of get rough. I would say he is very ignorant, stupid, and arrogant. I would even say that he is not a good person.
 Just an example: the BLM riots and the murder of George Floyd. He does not believe it was murder and is blindly pro-cop. He hasn‚Äôt seen the video however bc he doesn‚Äôt want to see a guy die. He thinks if it was a white guy, none of these riots, etc would have happened and nobody would have said anything. He thinks the cop losing his job was more than enough.
 I do not think my dad is evil. He is also a non-violent person, he‚Äôs not a redneck, etc. But he‚Äôs just so ignorant and indeed racist. He doesn‚Äôt align with conservatives or liberals and thinks it‚Äôs all a bunch of nonsense. But he sure acts conservative.
 
 I fight with him on these types of issues, me being fairly nuanced and liberal in my views, and he always says ‚Äúyou can have your opinion and I can have mine‚Äù. I agree with that to a certain extent, but sometimes that can‚Äôt be a viable excuse.
 
 Basically I want advice on what to do. I don‚Äôt want to disconnect from my dad. He‚Äôs never been abusive toward us and has always been greatly supportive and positive about me and my sister. But at the same time, these views of his are just immorally wrong based on ignorance and lack of compassion for anyone besides his family. Beyond what I‚Äôve already done which is trying to make him see his ignorance, what should I do? Should I give up because he‚Äôs set in his ways? Should I disconnect from him entirely because these views are inexcusable? Should I keep arguing but don‚Äôt take it too seriously? What should I do?","First off, it is OK to have different political views as someone else. You should NEVER let go of someone due to their political views especially someone that you love truly. Racist people are just people that need to be educated. Try to put the whole blm movement in his shoes. Ask him how he would feel if he had to see you being brutally suffocated crying out for his help. Tell him that george floyd was crying and screaming for his mother in his last moments and now his family members have to live in a world without him.

Am i making good progress?,"I‚Äôve been underweight for most, if not all of my life. The past year is when I started to want to change because I started to really resent people for constantly making remarks on my body, such as my skinny legs or arms whenever I wore anything that revealed my shape in the slightest. 
 
 I began my journey at 75 pounds in may 2022, and now I am at around 85 pounds or a little more. I never had any eating disorders, in fact I have always loved to eat, I just focused on eating a lot more calorie dense and protein rich food. The major change I made is that I started to go to the gym since may.
 
 I still get comments on my body despite the change, and it brings me down a lot. It makes me feel like the progress I‚Äôve done wasn‚Äôt enough. Of course there‚Äôs still a long way for me to go as I‚Äôm still underweight. I just want some reassurance.

Should I stay or should I go ?,"I'm 55, have about 5 years minimum until retirement. My wife is the same. Our home is paid off. One child finished with college, good job. The other has one year left. Both currently live with us and we're perfectly fine with that. We don't have debt. 
 
 Around 1996 we moved a half hour from our present location. Stayed there seven years. Had two kids. It was rural. I won't get into this too deep, but living quiet country was heaven for me. My wife not so much. After 7 years we moved back to our home town to raise our kids. I was heartbroken to be back in a fairly dense populated area. It's not inner city it's small town. We are surrounded by family. The understanding was always that we'd move back rural once the kids graduated high school (2.5 years ago) but it kinda just took a back seat. Now that the time is here I don't feel the same. But in the back of my mind I feel I'll be happier rural. My wife and I have looked at rural settings on and off for years. But the decision has always been a toss up. Now that our home is paid off it's even easier to just stay.
 
 Recently we found a rural home a half hour away. It's cherry, perfect condition, very nice location, and lots of potential for change/additions etc. What is unusual is the list price on this home is such that we would not owe much if anything after we moved and sold our present home. Have been told by several realtors that due to location, price range, size of lot, etc that our home will sell easily and quickly. I have elderly in laws within walking distance that I care about and would have some regret not being this close to them anymore. We are surrounded by family, they are here if needed, but rarely spend much time together just because we live across the street. It almost seemed like family ties were tighter when we lived country. Soo much has changed. I've changed. My kids are grown. I'm looking at retirement shortly.
 
 My wife would be OK staying here and putting some money into this home. (Garage, more elaborate outside entertaining areas, etc) I've always done enough to keep this house looking nice, comfortable living, etc but that's it. My heart was never in it and it was always been a temporary living situation to me. I only do what I feel is necessary and no more. Don't take much pride in it. I guess I've been somewhat resentful living here. But my wife is also willing to move. I know in my heart she's pretty happy here. I honestly can't predict if she'll hate it or be ok if we buy this other rural home. I'm tired of waiting it out. 
 
 Then there's the issue of retirement. Will we be moving south ? Following kids/grandkids ?
 
 I honestly don't know wether we should do this or not. Guess I'm not much of a risk taker but I know I'd be happier to live outside of a highly populated area and closer to nature.
 
 
 Should we stay put or move ?
 
 Thanks for reading !!!","So your wife is okay either way, your ties to your family were closer when you lived further away, and you really want to go to the rural area. The house is paid off so it‚Äôs easy to stay but your heart isn‚Äôt in it and you‚Äôve always wanted to go rural again. You found a great rural house.
 
 The only downsides are:
 
 You‚Äôll move further from your family, but a half hour is not a big issue at all. You can drive that every day if you need to.
 
 Your wife may be more comfortable at the current location. That being said, it seems like she doesn‚Äôt care too much either way but you care a lot. If you tell her how important it is to you, I‚Äôm sure she would go with it and not resent you.
 
 You might move again in the future to follow kids around, etc. yeah, but that‚Äôs true no matter where you are. Maybe you move again in 2-3 years but so be it, that‚Äôs life.
 
 It seems like you‚Äôve been looking forward to going rural again for a long time, you found a great house, and now is the time. I‚Äôd say you should have a big convo with your wife about it and don‚Äôt shy away from how much you want to move back out there again.
 
 I think I‚Äôm the grand scheme of things there‚Äôs really no risk here. The only downside is the hassle of moving which is a very temporary negative.",Home Advice,555,从农村出来，真的有必要回去再盖一栋房子吗？,0.6265,从农村出来的人们，你们老了还会回去吗？,0.6265,你们愿意把娃丢在农村吗?说说你们的看法？,0.6016,是什么让你决定留在小城市？,0.5884,你生活是理想的状态吗？有没有后悔当初的决定？,0.586,A,从农村出来，真的有必要回去再盖一栋房子吗？,False,D
I don‚Äôt know how to help my friend with an unhealthy relationship with weed,"My friend, let‚Äôs call him Saul, has been smoking weed since he was about 13. At the start it was fine in our minds, we were young enough not to consider the consequences of our actions. We were about 15-16 at the time, and he was really cool for his age and a younger sibling of one of my friends. We were young and didn‚Äôt have money, so the group of friends at the time fell out of the weekend mids and just hung out normally. 
 
 That wasn‚Äôt the case for Saul. 
 
 Saul, I don‚Äôt know how, managed to always get weed. Weekend sessions for him turned to every other day sessions, then turned to every day use. He made friends with a dealer that gave him as much free weed as he wanted, all of our new friend group smokes all the time except for two of us, and he can‚Äôt seem to be able to function without it. Even if he has bad experiences while high, He says he doesn‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs better than being sober. He stopped caring about everything else, he‚Äôs stopped pursuing his life goals and aspirations
 
 This is an unhealthy relationship with a substance. I want to help him. Every time I try, he gets aggressive and hostile. I don‚Äôt know what to do, but I feel like something must be done. All of us are in college now and he‚Äôs still in high school. I don‚Äôt want him to be set back in life because of this, and I feel a burden of responsibility and guilt because I was there when he first started smoking.

Cheating Dad?,"On mobile. My dad needed help connecting a printer to his phone. First app on the home screen is a dating app. Uh oh.

How do you convince yourself to feel like you haven't messed up and need to start over?,"Ever since meeting my (27f) current partner (26m) I've been through the ringer and have opened up to him about all my depression and trauma and insecurities not just from 2020 but definitely exacerbated by this year. 
 
 I told him that he met me at the lowest point in my life (few months ago) and I kept saying that there were times where I felt like I could do anything, if only he knew me then or will stick around until then, etc, sad stuff about when I get back to who I REALLY am and not this lonely, sad girl. He said if this is the lowest point of mine, its not that bad, and tells me he's not going anywhere anytime soon, and has been so open about listening, but I feel bad. 
 
 Problem is I'm not 100% so I keep bringing it up and apologize for bringing it up and then apologize for apologizing. I keep thinking I'm annoying him or misinterpret his words and then apologize, and he tells me that it's actually okay. 
 
 I lost SO many people this year bc they either left me and told me that I brought up my depression and family too much, or they were slowly phasing me out (and not for political reasons, gotta clarify bc US). Sounds dramatic and I wish I was lying, but I haven't nearly discussed my depression as much as I have been lately. 
 
 I have abandonment issues and I've been deep in my head for all the reasons why and how much IS my fault, any sort of reason why they'd just ignore me and bail, bc my biggest fear is I'm the asshole and no one told me.

 But for now, how do I stop this from becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy? How can I convince myself that I won't bring it up too much and drive him away despite what he says? I didn't think I'd hit other peoples limits and that fear is why I can't get it out of my head. How do I shut myself up?

Should I be as mad as I am?,"My family and I are not on talking terms me being the bank for the family when I had little money stopped when I got married and had my own family to take care of but the resentment and constant begging me for money never stopped. About three (3) years ago I just stopped talking to them and stopped letting them meddle in my life. So at 18 I moved in with my grandmother on my moms side. Lovely woman helped through a lot of stuff like college, first girlfriend (yes I know I was a late bloomer being 19 at the time) breakup. She even helped me decide to join the military when I was in my 20s. I spent many years growing up spending weeks with her during the summer. We had a good relationship. A few years ago she moved in with an uncle down in North Carolina because she had Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia. I would send her cards on her birthday and Christmas. So I was having some thoughts about grandma in the last few weeks and tried getting in touch. Well my family wouldn‚Äôt respond and with a little internet search I found out she passed away this year and they had a huge family gathering that I was not informed or invited to. And I was only 12 hours away during that time.

I actually hate myself. How do I build confidence from square one (or zero)?,"I am 21F and I have zero self confidence. I finally broke down earlier because I felt so miserable and exhausted and hated myself so much that I really wanted to die. I was crying so hard I just didn‚Äôt know what to do. In the past week, I have actually seriously considered suicide for the first time. I had a pretty rough childhood but I don‚Äôt know why I feel so depressed and anxious despite having a MUCH better childhood than a lot of people. My family had a lot of financial stress growing up. My mom was (and is still) a hoarder and an alcoholic. I was always the least favorite child, but I‚Äôm going to be 100% honest I always had food on my plate, a roof over my head, and clean clothes on my body. I felt that my parents didn‚Äôt have the time or mental state to show affection for me properly when I was younger, but they did really try to keep my siblings and I alive and healthy. My mother is still very emotionally abusive, although the physical abuse (which was minimal-spanking simply because she was angry and slapping) did stop before I moved out for college. I was bullied a lot growing up. The worst and most long lasting effect is that I have zero self confidence in my appearance. When I say bullied, I suppose I should clarify (but not diminish) my situation. I moved around a lot and everywhere I moved, people called me ugly. This happened from pre school through very recently in college. It stopped for a bit when I unfortunately was subject to educational neglect (kept out of school for 4.5 years due to laziness of my parents). It wasn‚Äôt just calling me ugly-it was calling me a ‚Äúthing‚Äù, telling me to kms, telling me that no one would ever want to have sex with me, telling me that I was too ugly to be chosen for job and school opportunities, telling me not to smile, saying that I‚Äôm too ugly to be hugged etc. These encounters have recently sloped downwards significantly, although in the past year I have been called ugly twice (I believe the remark was ‚ÄúEW‚Äù both times) by random sober college-aged guys in public. In high school, I was actually doing really well for a bit and was almost elected President of an organization that I was really passionate about. All of a sudden, a friend that wanted the same position started spreading lies about me and everyone isolated me and all of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù would frequently refer to me as an ‚Äúugly btch‚Äù. My mother and a few women in our city were involved in this character assassination against me. A lifetime of difficulty at home coupled with incessant teasing made me feel absolutely worthless. I‚Äôm legitimately surprised that I‚Äôm alive. I‚Äôm surprised that I haven‚Äôt offed myself yet because if I knew when I was little that it would only get worse I think I would have gone through with it. I have quite a bit of support now but even though the comments have stopped, I feel worse. I don‚Äôt know what went wrong-I think about what people said about me more now than I did then. I still wear a mask because I don‚Äôt want people to see my face. I hate leaving my dorm room and sometimes I sleep for days on end. My grades are slipping-I used to be a straight A student. I‚Äôve just started Lexapro (my first attempt at medication ever) after having severe anxiety since the 7th grade. I LIVE to impress people. I‚Äôm convinced that every interaction gone south is because of my appearance and I‚Äôve started to blame my failures on ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù. I tried therapy for 3 sessions last semester but I didn‚Äôt feel that it helped because I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to tell my therapist about my issues with my appearance because I was that humiliated. I seriously need help and I don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I was very successful in college for a bit and I‚Äôm about to ruin it because I‚Äôm spiraling.

Is a degree in Business Administration worth it?,"Hi everyone. First off, thank you for taking the time to read this and to post an answer if you do. With that out of the way, here's some context.
 
 If you don't want context, here's the questions; Is a business degree worth it for financial advising? If so, how can I convince my father to let me switch programd to go into business so I can feel more engaged with what I'm doing?
 
 I am going through the 2nd semester of my first year in university, working towards a degree in Computer Science. I started doing Calculus this semester and have been having a bit of trouble with it as I go on with it and I haven't been enjoying doing any code as I continue into this degree.
 
 Before continuing, I do plan to speak to an academic advisor and career advisor next week to talk about switching programs and if it would be right for me. I've been having a tough time trying to decide what I want to do with school as my parents never allowed me a break after high school to think about what I'd like to do.
 
 I was looking into doing a degree in Business Administration, as it can help me get a job in financial advising with a bank, and it means I can help people with this job as well hopefully. Not only that but because I had to drop Comp Sci for a semester before, I had to play catch up in order to get back to where I should be. After this semester, my first year courses for Comp Sci still wouldn't be complete. I'd have to take another science elective as I need 2 science electives for 1 pair in order to even be eligible to apply for a major in Comp Sci.
 
 With Business Administration, I just have to switch a course out for a business course instead, then pass that course, and my calculus class. By that point, I'd have my first year towards a Business Administration degree done where I did 2 business courses in a general year before transferring to university.
 
 I done some research on financial advising jobs to see if I'd enjoy it, and I figured, ""I'm helping people with their money and problems regarding it. This can also help me develop one-on-one skills in communication."" which is fine for me as I enjoy helping others, seeing how they're doing, etc.
 
 I found that financial advisors can earn up to $90k, which seems to be around the same, or just a tad less than what I wanted to do with CS, but that's fine by me as I don't need to be rich to be happy. Living in a decently sized house for a possible family of 4 would be great for me.
 
 Now here's another problem with this; my father is leaned more towards me doing stuff in CS or even in the medical field. I currently have no interest in either. I enjoyed the business courses I did previously honestly, even if they were a bit of a pain sometimes. I don't know how I can convince my father that a business degree will not set me up for failure as I believe it won't. If anything, I feel it will pull me forward as I'm still playing catch up with CS currently.
 
 If I can convince my father to let me switch, then I'm going to be talking to my advisors next week to make sure this would be something I'd like to do, or explore other careers. However, for the time being, how can I convince my father to let me switch programs in order to persue a career in which I can probably feel more engaged?
 
 Thank you in advance for your time and answers!","It sounds as if you would maximize your potential by switching to a Business Administration major.

How can I help here,"I(17f) was supposed to travel to NYC for a school trip this week. I was super excited and everything but now because the coronavirus, my teacher had to cancel with the travel agency. It really sucks but the thing I'm most worried about is that I don't think my parents do insurance. The trip cost about $2,000 and while my teacher said he will do everything he can to get some of our money back I don't think we will be seeing much of that money back.
 
 I feel upset obviously because I won't get to go, I'm a senior so this was my last chance but I feel even worse about possible puting my family out $2,000 bucks. I work a part time job at a restaurant and while I kinda hate it, it is a nice starting experience and I do get paid decent enough. I want to pick up some extra hours to help get back that money but my mom keeps telling me not to worry and that she will pick up some time, she is a nurse. Even if I go ahead and pick up some time my mom will probably just tell me to save my money for things I want/college. Well I want to help but I can't convince her to let me.
 
 I know paying off $2,000 with a minimum wage job is hard but spring break is coming up and school ends in a couple months meaning I will have the time to put in. I right now work two days a week because of school and make about $9-$11 an hour and have almost 2,000 dollars in my bank account.

"Getting ""back into life"" and now feeling lonely...","Hello people, i've been really lonely for the past years, it was pretty much just me and at least some family. No friends or anything like that. Literally been sitting at home all day, didn't have a job.
 
 Now things started to change a month ago when i finally found a job. Had to go through a training class for the job which lasted 4 weeks, met new people who are my colleagues now and we all get along super well. Went to the cinema with some of them yesterday and they even invited me to a games night on friday.
 
 So you could say that things are starting to go really well for me.
 
 However, today the training ended and I had my first few hours at the actual job. I work in customer support now so I speak to a lot of people on the phone. Immediately after my shift ended, I started to have a weird feeling which by now, 5 hours later, I think I identified as loneliness and fear of failure in the new job.
 
 I don't understand that. I have never really felt lonely when I actually was lonely but now that I'm starting to make friends again, I am scared... 
 
 I was just wondering if someone might have some advice for me or something, i don't really know.

I need help being a better sister to my little brother.,"TL;DR: Need some tips to talk to little brother more often and to stop ignoring him 
 
 Sometimes he bothers me and my older siblings to get some attention and I don‚Äôt like it but now that I think about it, it‚Äôs because we don‚Äôt really talk to him. 
 
 I‚Äôm trying to be nicer to him when he tries to get some attention instead of ignoring him but it‚Äôs kinda hard to do that because my 2 older sisters ignored me for like 8 years straight did that to me when I was his age but it took them a while to actually interact with me more often.
 
 If it helps I can describe the main way he tries to get attention. The main way he tries to get our attention is to talk about the topic of the video he‚Äôs watching on the tv since he doesn‚Äôt have the have a phone or iPad for some reason. For example, if he‚Äôs watching Minecraft mod videos he‚Äôll talk about how it allows you to spawn herobrine or something overpowered even when I‚Äôm clearly not looking or paying attention.

"At a crossroads, struggling with a decision.","Its not a super serious one I suppose. Over the years I think i‚Äôve come close to finding my passion. I didn‚Äôt go to college when I was 18 because my parents discouraged it and I didn‚Äôt fully know what I wanted.
 
 Over the years though, Ive realized a couple things about myself. I love helping people, I love jobs that feel like they have greater purpose, and I love working from home lol. 
 
 So now, at 23, I‚Äôm going to be going back to school. My two contenders right now are art education or art therapy. As of right now, Art Therapy is the one that sounds most appealing to me. I want to be able to help people on a more direct level, I want to be able to have a degree that gives me a lot of opportunity, and I want the chance at working from home.
 
 However, its a 6 year degree. I would have to get my masters, then complete hours within the field, and take a certification exam. This would be fine, but all the sources i‚Äôm seeing are saying its expensive. I believe i‚Äôll be getting Fafsa for a couple years though so this might help.
 
 A teaching degree on the other hand might be cheaper and take less time, but I think it might come with limited opportunities and be less in line with my core values.
 
 I guess my question is, do I follow the career path that will be difficult and expensive to obtain the job I love, or do I settle for a job I might love, but if I hate theres limited opportunities?
 
 I hope this isn‚Äôt an odd question, thank you guys for reading.","First of all, I am glad to hear you have such pure motivations for doing any of this; staying in touch with your core values is one of the most stabilizing and fulfilling things you can do.
 
 I¬¥ll share 2 core practices that can be very helpful for making any decision in life-
 
 1. Ask yourself a question at the top of a sheet of paper, and answer it. Try to get down to the root of what you are wanting to know before answering. You can set a timer for a period of time (maybe 20-45 min), go rapid- fire if no answers are coming up, or really think about it before writing. Do what feels right.
 
 First, since this is such a big decision, I would consider if you want to pursue either one. You could ask something like ""What am I wanting to achieve by completing this degree?"", then ""Is it worth it?"". If it is, you could ask ""What are my other options for making this a reality?"". You may find that there are many options for fulfilling those core values, and some may resonate even more than these 2.
 
 If you still decide to go with one of these, you can use the same contemplation practice to help you decide. 
 
 2. If that does not lead to your decision, try intuition. Anytime you find yourself in a quiet mental space, try feeling both options in your body and see which one ""opens"" you, which feels more fulfilling. We often have a bunch of mental overlay distracting us from the truth that we know in our bones.

Is it bad if i legitimately get no enjoyment out of social interaction,"I used to be a bit of a clown and banter a lot with friends and classmates. I've always been more introverted but do enjoy some select people and can joke around with anyone. 9 months of quarantine (only normal amounts of household interaction, only sporadically talking to friends) has changed me in some way. Now whenever i talk on the phone with someone or chat with an old bud, i feel absolutely nothing. Even if the conversation isn't boring. Not irritated with talking to them, just like ""i am not enjoying myself"". I've gone into depressive states in the past and hermit-ed up because i wanted to be alone in my misery but this isn't that. I feel normal i just don't have any desire to socialize. I'm worried about myself and if I'm becoming stuffy or numb in some way? Or is this just me not clicking with those specific people anymore? Is this anything to worry about?
 
 Sorry if this is too general, i just don't have anyone to talk to about this and was hoping i could find some clarity here.","Honestly, I wouldn't worry too much! I used to be a super extroverted person but after staying home for so long I've lost interest in keeping up with a lot of acquaintances/distant-ish friends.
