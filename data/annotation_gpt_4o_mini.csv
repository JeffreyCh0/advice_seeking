I’m not sure were to post this so I’ll just leave it here in hopes that someone sensible will find and read it and hopefully give me some advice.
I’m nearing 30 years old and I feel so lost in my social life. That is to say I have none. I don’t have friends, I don’t go out on my free-time, I tend to stay away from social gatherings and even grocery shopping takes a lot out of me. The only people I talk to is my co workers when I am at work and my parents every now and again. The thought of “going to new places and meeting people” is enough to leave me parallelized in bed. I hate when I mention “loneliness” that the first couple of responses is always on the line of “well then go out and meet people”. I feel like I’m just a burden and creep when I’m out. Why would I approach a group when they already have their friends and place within that friendship. Why would anyone consider taking me into a part of their social group?


I work out ( I have a home gym), try to eat right and spend my time reading and trying to learn new things. I live in a small town in Maine so I don’t have any opportunities  to “join clubs”, “enjoy the nightlife”, or any other activities others suggest to meet new people. And even if I was afforded such chances the idea of “meeting new people” on my own is terrifying. I’m short and awkward. I don’t understand many of the social norms and unwritten rules that others follows. And since I’m not a hunter,fisher, or partake in “beefing up” my vehicle or go “offroading” I find myself lurking through online libraries and watching YouTube all day. 



When I do manage to muster the energy and will to go for a walk around my town I find it so hard to even look up from the ground and wave and say hello to someone passing me by. I always make it a point to not make eye contact and move quickly pass them. It’s frustrating on one end I’m scared to make contact with somebody else and therefore I do my best to stay alone but I do such a good job of it that the social isolation is slowly killing me. 



I just don’t know what else or where else to go. I hate people and yet I want to have at least one friend. I feel so depressed lately and its been getting worse and worse. I don’t want to go back to therapy. After nearly 10 years I’ve pretty much heard it all and done what I can do improve my position in life and yet I’m still in the same spot. My anxiety and paranoia leaves me in a lonely spot. I am starting to hate my life and everyday is becoming the same routine to the point that work is the only way I can tell my days apart. I had  girlfriend two years ago but that ended with her going back to her ex and leaving me a wreck. I refuse to use social media because I am an extremely private person. I uphold privacy in the highest regard to the point where I feel as if it’s affecting my life in a negative way. I just don’t know to to make and maintain relationships in general. 



I need help but I’m not sure in what form and how to get it. I want to feel normal or maybe I’m just cursed to be lonely and fighting off these depressive thoughts. I just want a friend or for someone to point me in the right direction. Maybe I’m autistic, maybe I’m an incel and I just never knew. I just wish I knew what the hell is wrong with me so I can feel a tad bit better. 


If anyone does read this please help. I just don’t know what to do any more. All I know I can’t keep going on like this."

277361699,j9gqqo,男人在乎女人胖吗？,"How do guys feel about overweight girls? Is it possible to be liked?
Okay so a bit of a backstory

I'm quite overweight, and realistically not very attractive. I don't rlly have any guy friends and I'm pretty sure guys who I meet aren't interested in me romantically. I don't think I'm boring or not found to be around, I'm actually quite satisfied with my character. But the look department is objectively lacking.

Now, my friend has sorta manipulated me into a double date. I felt bad for the guy that he was left to talk to me one on one so from the start i tried to let it be known that I'm not interested in him romantically as I didn't want to make things awkward. It ended up well, he walked me to the bus station after the hangout but never asked for my number or anything.

Just today, about a month later, from my friends I found out that she and her bf actually showed the guy a picture of me and HE KNEW it was a set up that he approved of (although, I don't look in pics like irl lmao). And after the whole thing, the guy told my friend's boyfriend that he didn't see even in slightest that I was interested in him, I didn't flirt with him and we talked about university stuff (I don't usually talk about school with my friends, but it seemed like a neutral appropriate topic back there). 

I was very surprised to hear that I was, in fact, the one who rejected a possibility of getting to know each other to the root. But it's still quite hard to believe he liked me, or any other guy.

So, fundamentally, my question is, how do guys perceive overweight girls, would they go for them and am I really the problem in my no-boyfriend situation here?"

22211180,esc3m3,该不该把兴趣当做事业？,"Passion or money (chef or construction)
Hello, I’m 28 years old and I’ve been an industrial pipe fitter for 9 years. I can make great money when the work is there, which is inconsistent. 
But the work is difficult and dangerous, I’ve had a couple near death experiences and I’m still recovering from breaking my right hand while drilling a 1” hole with a hand drill, while 20 feet in the air in a harness and lanyard. 
The work isn’t all bad I have lots of fun with co workers. But I’ve always had a feeling deep down this isn’t what I’m supposed to be doing, this isn’t what I want to do my whole life. My dad has done it all of his adult life and his back is always in pain. It comes with the job for most part.
For a long time I’ve been thinking of what I want to do, and it’s always come back to becoming a chef. I’ve been passionate about cooking for 15 years and just a couple years ago started baking sourdough bread (when there was no pipe fitting jobs) and selling it. Even made an instagram for it @doctordoughboy . Lol. 
Now the money is drastically less, and that scares me. I’m recently married with a baby on the way. I want to provide a great life for my family. I feel that if I put all my effort into cooking I can provide a good life for family. 
Am I making the wrong decision here? Should I put my passion aside and continue to pursue pipe fitting? I am good at that job and have great benefits and whatnot.  Any advice from a chef would be great!"

I'm in my second year of nursing school and we ran into a situation where I'm not sure if we're in serious trouble or not.

After that midterm students became aware that all questions were taken from an online textbook resource of multiple choice questions. Because of it being such a small class size word eventually made it to all members of the group. The professor was made aware that the class knew about the online resource and then almost the entire class studied from that resource for the final. Many people got 100% because again all questions were taken from that resource for the final.

I can't Google this because it's so weird. I been drinking like a fish since I turned 21 and I'm 24. like every alcoholic, I've told myself that I'm gonna get sober, but it never sticks. I always stay sober for less than a week before I get back on the bottle again. 

The 13th of this month I woke up with a 2 day hangover and this feeling that I just didn't wanna do it anymore. It was this sudden feeling in my gut that reminds me almost of Forrest Gump just deciding to start running. I just one day decided that I didn't wanna do something I'd been doing almost everyday for 3 years. Sobriety was difficult at first, but despite that, I just didn't care to drink. I found hobbies and had a few realizations about what I'd let my life become. I realized that alcohol had blinded me to alot of shit that needed doing. 

The thing is that no one will take me seriously because I've cried wolf too many times. I wouldn't believe me either. There was no single moment. There was no big thing that made me decide to force myself to be sober. I just woke up like this. I was worried that it wouldn't stick at first, but I got trashed last night just because I had the money...and....I guess because I wanted to see what would happen. I went on a drunk adventure with someone. I had a night that the old me would have loved, but I didnt enjoy it. It wasnt worth how I feel this morning. I make fun of my two best friends for being in bed by 9 and not partying with me, but I found myself wishing that I'd just hungout with them and went to bed at a normal time instead of drinking till 5am. 

I'm just curious if anyone knows what would cause this. I dont know if it's gonna stick. maybe I'll wake up changed back or something. Just looking for some advice because I'm really confused and no one will listen to me and discuss this shit. No one believes that I've changed."

364386829,gdx5bw,自己每天总爱胡思乱想怎么办？,"How do I stop overthinking?
I can’t stop overthinking because of my terrible mental health. I’ve tried meditation, it works but after half an hour I’d start overthinking again.

I overthink more about philosophy questions rather than what to do. I would think ‘what if this happens, what would be the best decision and how would I deal with it’. They’re not useless questions and it’s quite fun to think about sometimes. 
It’s just that when it’s not just thinking a little bit about it and forming my own opinion, it gets really obsessive to the point where I would get anxiety attacks. I don’t think I need to stop thinking about the questions, I just need to learn to give myself a break and not to be obsessive.

There’s also not a specific source. Anything could happen and I’d be lost in thoughts.

I was wondering if anyone had some tips on how to stop overthinking or how to distract myself from my own thoughts?"

Hey, 

I'm 26M

I've had a lot of childhood trauma,albeit not like the one you usually see in the movies, but it was trauma enough to leave a lot of scars that I continue to deal with.

My parents did not invest enough in my early childhood education, didnot encourage me to take up sports, I was beaten occasionally, verbally abused and also bullied by classmates and cousins alike.

Now, I see that one of my parent seems to have changed from the time when I was young.

But I still feel that the experiences I had when I was young still dictate my life pretty significantly.

I feel that I'm ugly, with no personality, no communication skills and I have never felt loved in my life, despite having never lived physically alone.

Sometimes I also feel suicidal and think that maybe I should just end it all at once, but I beleive that I still deserve to give myself a second chance at life.

How do I start afresh and let go of all my insecurities and scars.

Also, I dont think I can afford therapy at this point in time, so please give me that ""Go get a therapist""-Bull crap.

Hello, Reddit. This is my first post. I lurk on here a lot, but I’m in a bit of a pickle. I work as a Final Inspector at a local factory that makes Honda parts. I have had this job for close to 2 years. A great opportunity for a job has presented itself. While this job is another factory job, I could see myself staying here long-term if I get the job. This company has very low turnover, great benefits, and I like their values. I really want this job. Sounds great right, but no there’s one BIG problem. Before getting my current job, I bounced around a LOT. Mostly minimum wage jobs and a few temp agency jobs. I would probably be known as a serial hopper. I have an interview at this company on Thursday morning, but I had to disclose my full work history on the application. Just typing it all out made me feel sick. This company was already interested in me due to my experience and me being a woman. I already passed the testing phase, and I would hate to go through all that just to fail now. Is there any hope for me or am I doomed? Will I only be judged on my past? I feel like such a failure, and I have so many regrets. If it matters, I am a 22 year old college student."

For some reason, I think it's based on these past experiences that I had when I was younger where I was constantly feeling alone in this world, ignored, not having a consistent level of reliable warmth, affection, and love.. Where I just wasn't getting enough emotional connection in my life. 

It's like, my mind doesn't put those feelings into words but instead it summarizes those past experiences into this terrible fear that causes me pain and sorrow. Which my mind then says ""you don't have reassurance, you don't have warmth, you don't have anyone out there for you."" I just can't be at peace with the idea that I'm going to be...alone. 

Is this what it is to suffer from trauma? To have that unsettled truth replay in your head over and over again? It's like a headache where it just stays there pulsating, giving you pain and suffering. All because there's this need that I'm not getting.

I guess I have a history of not having meaningful relationships in my life. Not being with people who gave me that emotional engagement that made me feel ""validated"" in this world.

TLDR: New boo agrees with me about basic stuff (e. g. capitalism has been harmful, homophobia is bad, helping people is good) but he's never done much critical thinking when it comes to bigger sociopolitical conversations.  What's a good movie to fuel this discussion?

EDIT: Were both black if it matters. He's male, I'm female.

So I just started seeing this guy. We have great sexual chemistry and good conversation. We don't have much history behind us yet but this is one of my more intentional relationships-- actual dates, good morning texts, and the lot. The problem is despite him having most of his life together in terms of being financially stable, taking care of his family, etc. we don't seem to share the same values. 

Though nothing about his character is oppositional to mine, my casual conversations with my friends might include giving fake Trump speeches about pulling yourself up by your very big bootstraps or discussing how Love is Blind only honors conventional standards of beauty for women and doesn't have any queer relationships. On the other hand, normal conversation for him and his friends is talking about anime and TV.

Think of him as Raj from The Big Bang Theory except much more confident. He hides his nerdy interior pretty well but he's in his late 20s and doesn't drink and do drugs. Not that I want him to but it just points to his overall naivety. I don't expect this relationship to last long, to be very frank, but I genuinely want to expose him to as much as possible while I'm around and give him the chance to think about some deeper values. It seems like he's just never had the opportunity to think critically. His life has just been studying hard, securing a good job, fending for his family, and being entertained by media. 

Generally he doesn't like any of my Netflix reccomendations. For example, one of my favorite shows is Bojack Horseman. He said he can't even get past one episode. I'm guessing it's because it's too depressing for him but dark comedy in general is pretty central to my character. He's never even heard of Blue Is The Warmest Color. (I'm queer and my sense of stylistic expression is obtuse to the point that most people simply assume I'm a lesbian. It took him a while to figure this out, after asking me to wear a dress and having a conversation about whether someone should come out to their partner. Finally, he just asked. But it's almost weird that he didn't know til this point because I've made a few blunt jokes about it.)

Because of these differences, we always fight over what to watch, playfully, and though I've told him I don't like action comedy he's adamant on convincing me I do. After many a failed selections he's said that I can have the final decision on what we watch next. I'm thinking something either anti-capitalist or queer. He's already watched Parasite or Sorry To Bother You and he thought both films were weird and confusing, but good. Does anyone have any reccomendations for our next film? Obviously he likes comedy but we just watched Ozark so he can get darker. I'm thinking Rent or Tangerine but I really need a good pick."
31636638,dg2uzl,不知道自己该做什么工作又不喜欢现在的工作怎么办？,"I dislike every job I've had but I need money
I (23M) feel completely lost on what to do with my life because despite weaving in and out of various careers I've never found anything I enjoy doing. Worse even, I've never found anything I didn't actively dislike. I've worked in restaurants, for a magazine publisher, for a film studio, in a library, and currently I am a freelance video editor. 

I have moderate social anxiety, and that's part of the reason I have hated every job I've had so much. The stress of making mistakes, wondering what your boss and colleagues think of you, and being afraid to ask for help have made every position a cesspool of stress, but even if that weren't the case, my complete disinterest in work deprives me of any passion or drive. I feel like there's something wrong with me because my friends all have either found something they love, or are working day jobs they don't mind while pursuing what they love. 

The only thing I've found that I enjoy doing and can be monetized is writing.  I've written three feature length screenplays just for fun, but that is a near impossible career to break into and requires so much more than just the writing aspect but also cold calling agents, competitions, the politics of show business, and all of that also drains me of any sort of drive. I've written a novella, memoirs, and am starting on a novel, but even if I somehow managed to publish anything it's not like that could pay my bills unless it was a best-seller. 

I thought being self-employed as an editor would be an ideal compromise because I could largely work from home and it's creative and there's no office politics, but again, the anxiety of dealing with clients and the competitive nature of the work has left me living paycheck to paycheck since I don't fight to obtain new clients and instead just take whatever comes along. I can manage rent and groceries but with other bills, like car stuff, popping up, I'm starting to fall into debt. It's now dawning on me I need to actually find something that I can make money on or else I'll be in trouble, but the thought of that fills me with dread because I have few marketable skills, the job market where I live is dwindling, and I'm afraid to commit to something just so I can slave away and hate my life. 

I've considered something low stress and then just working on my writing on the side, but every job like that, say retail at a bookstore or something, pays minimum wage and I can't sustain myself on that. 

I'm well-aware this post probably sounds whiny or immature, and you may be thinking ""Just grow up and find a job, it's what everyone else is doing"" but I just can't see the point of wasting the majority of my life on something terrible just so I can afford to live."

21252039,vso2s2,如何零基础学习钢琴？,"What should i know before learning/purchasing piano?
Pretty much title. I (15M) have wanted to learn piano or any musical instrument in fact for a long time. I tried flute but it never really was my thing so i stopped pretty soon. I wanted to try guitar but school was in the way thus i couldnt get lessons. 

Last option is piano as there are tons and tons of videos on youtube on how to learn and its propably even my most favourite instrument. I want to buy some cheaper piano for starters but since i never actually learned chords/notes or really anything else about music iam not sure wether i should jump straight in."

Hi all! I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit, but here we go. Basically I haven’t read for my own enjoyment in years. I loved reading in middle school, I read all the YA novels under the sun. My attention span is fucked so reading is kinda hard, but I really want to get back into it. Do you guys have any recommendations that could help me rekindle my love for reading? Thanks in advance!"

So I am a beginner doodler. I doodle out of pure love. Most of my works are imitative. 2%-5% probably is original ( they are all cartoons).

I feel like i would lose ANY originality i might have left in me. That i wouldnt develop my own style and these thoughts eat me alive sometimes. Any suggestion?"

I like the idea of teaching at the college level. I know I would enjoy it. But when I mentioned to some coworkers that I was in the early stages of considering a PhD so I can teach, they all collectively said that's not what it's for and that I should only consider it if I want to do research for a living or want an executive level position in our field.  Is that bullshit or are they right?"

I honestly cant believe I failed. Im a fine driver and every time I practiced parallel parking I succeeded. Every K turn, U turn, back up, etc. was totally passable.

Then, I got to the test and I shit you not I failed a minute into it. I did my parallel parking fine but I pulled up too far to straighten out and hit the front cones meaning I instantly failed. I know it was just me miscalculating due to stress and its a mistake I wouldn’t have made in pretty much any other circumstances. I should’ve just backed up to avoid getting so damn close. But, it still happened.

How do I calm down? I cant stop beating up on myself and im terrified I’ll do the same thing when I retake it in 2 weeks. And, its my birthday today so this whole thing is making it really hard to enjoy pretty much anything. I know its overdramatic but i’m just really freaking out."

24374457,g26mo4,在家学习环境明明是最好的，如何才能让自己在家更有状态学习呢？,"How can I stay focused on schoolwork being forced to do it at home?
25M Ex-military on GI Bill in second year of college. 

I have too many distractions at home. I know this. It's the reason I (typically) take all classes in-seat. (Typically) I do not do any of my homework or studying at home. None. I stay at the school until i am finished with what i need to do, and only then do i go home.

Unfortunately (and i'm not blaming anyone for this) the school is closed. I am forced to take all this work home with me. School has been back in for a month now or so and I have severely fallen behind. I just cannot motivate myself to do work. I have accepted that either i need to change something ASAP, or will I fail the classes. As i sit, my GPA will have a significant blow to it after this semester falling from a 3.8 i just don't know how far.

I have a gaming desktop that I do all my class work on, as my school laptop is simply much slower and  cannot handle the video lectures+schoolwork at the same time. **Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get myself refocused?**

My only idea is I do have the means to purchase a second new laptop that would be capable to handle my schoolwork, and refraining from doing any schoolwork around my games leaving me only the TV as a distraction."
